Hi! I'm a grad student studying Programming Languages at Northwestern.
This page provides information about myself and what I have been doing recently.
The other half of the site is a blog that I use to practice writing about technical things, my research, and my interests.
Hopefully it's a little interesting.

** Research Interests
Broadly, I'm interested in Programming Languages approaches to improving software development.
This concretely means investigating how language features can improve program robustness, understandability, and maintainability.
Doing so involves understanding the fundamental meanings of those features, how they interact, and how they impact programmers.
To those ends, I use reduction semantics as a primary tool for modeling and understanding various languages and their features.
Additionally, I work on the [[https://racket-lang.org/][Racket]] programming language as a test bed for implementing, using, and evaluating new features or languages.

** Contact information
My github profile is [[https://github.com/llazarek][llazarek]].

I can be reached by email at
