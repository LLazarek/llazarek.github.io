I'm a grad student studying Programming Languages at Northwestern.
This page provides information about myself and what I have been doing recently.
The other half of the site is a blog that I use to practice writing about technical things, my research, and my interests.

** Research Interests
I'm interested in Programming Languages approaches to make programming accessible and practically useful for human beings.

People and their programs are imperfect, so one part of that interest is in linguistic tools that support program robustness and debugging;
my ongoing work on contract systems and gradual typing centers around evaluating how these specification tools, intended to improve robustness, may or may not assist with debugging.

Relatively few people are programmers, however, so another part of my interest is understanding how and why everyone else might find value in programming;
my current work in this direction explores languages, domains, and settings which enable novices to use computing as a useful tool, while simultaneously providing a rich setting for digging deeper into foundational computing concepts.

I work on and use the [[https://racket-lang.org/][Racket]] programming language as a concrete setting for most of my research.
