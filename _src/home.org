I'm a grad student studying Programming Languages at Northwestern.
This page provides information about myself and what I have been doing recently.
The other half of the site is a blog that I use to practice writing about technical things, my research, and my interests.

** Research Interests
I am a PhD student studying Programming Languages at Northwestern University, graduating in winter 2024 and on the job market for my next step.

My research has been about data-driven Programming Languages approaches to understanding what and how language features are practically useful.

People and their programs are imperfect, so one part of that work is in linguistic tools that support program robustness, monitoring, and debugging;
my ongoing work on contract systems and gradual typing centers around empirically evaluating how these specification tools, intended to improve robustness, may or may not assist with debugging through experimental data collection and analysis.

Relatively few people are programmers, however, so another part of my research is understanding how and why everyone else might find value in programming; my work in this direction explores languages, domains, and tools which enable non-experts to quickly make use of computing, while simultaneously providing a rich setting to learn about and apply powerful computing ideas to practical problems.

I work on and use the [[https://racket-lang.org/][Racket]] programming language as a concrete setting for most of my research.
